### 3.6.50925 - Upgrade to vNext

Project converted to Visual Studio 2015 and new project type (`xproj`).

New demo console app added (`TelegramBotDemo-vNext`) for testing under `dnx451` runtime. Old demo app ('classic' console project) also available, but **Attention! Now it grabs package from nuget!** (because old-style .csproj can't reference new .xproj assemblies directly).

All real changes were already implemented in `3.5.50816`, only some documenation/comments are updated in this version.

* Changes in Telegram API defined as [July 2015](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api-changelog#july-2015) implemented (issue #7):

 * `Caption` and `Duration` optional fields have been added to the `SendVideo` request.

### 3.4.50815 - Webhooks support, bugfixes

Improvements for working via webhooks:

* `DeserializeUpdate` method added to convert webhook POST json value to `Update` object

Fixed issue #6 with sending files with non-latin characters in name.

### 3.3.50701 - DateTimeOffset instead of long

`Message` properties `Date` and `ForwardDate` are now DateTimeOffset (converted to local time).

### 3.2.50628 - With sending files

Methods for sending files (`SendPhoto`, `SendVideo`, etc) implemented.

### 3.1.50627 - Using HttpClient

Switched to HttpClient (instead of HttpRequest):

* no more `System.Web` dependency;
* `MakeRequest` method is now async only, use `.Result` or `.Wait()` for synchronous calls

### 2.1.50626 - Requests hierarchy

Refactored to new request model - base `RequestBase` class and one (and one async) `MakeRequest` method.

Major version increased to "2", patch version set to current date.

Response class hierarchy (`Types`), first requests. It works!
